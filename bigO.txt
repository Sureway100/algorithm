1. bigO is a numerical representation of how efficient our algorithm and data structure is.
2. how our code performs as compareed to others
3. when your code slows down or crashes, identifying part of the codes that are 
efficient can help us find the pain points in our application
4. bigO is about readability, less memory, more readable
